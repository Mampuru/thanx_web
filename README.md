# Thanx_web

[![My Skills](https://skillicons.dev/icons?i=vue,js,tailwind)](https://skillicons.dev)

Thanx is a reward platform for any transaction a user partakes in.

## How to run
* npm run install:clean (If you are on a linux based terminal)
* npm run build:tailwind  (each time you add a new class, a class that does not exist in src/assets/styles/tailwind.css, you will need to run this command)
* npm run serve
